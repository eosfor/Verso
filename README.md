## Why Verso

Microsoft deprecated Polyglot Notebooks on February 11, 2026, and .NET Interactive, the engine that powered it, followed the same path. Together they were the primary way to run interactive C#, F#, PowerShell, and SQL in a notebook. Their deprecation left a gap in the .NET ecosystem: no maintained notebook platform, and no maintained embeddable execution engine.

Verso fills both roles.

**As a notebook platform**, Verso runs in VS Code or any browser, ships with IntelliSense and variable sharing across nine languages, and imports existing `.ipynb` and `.dib` files. If you used Polyglot Notebooks, the experience will feel familiar.

**As an engine**, the core is a headless .NET library with no UI dependencies. It provides multi-language execution, an extension host, a variable store, and a layout manager through a clean set of public interfaces. If you embedded .NET Interactive in a tool, service, or workflow, the Verso engine serves the same purpose with a fully extensible architecture. Reference the NuGet package, wire up a `Scaffold`, and you have a programmable notebook runtime in any .NET application.

The architecture is built on one principle: every feature is an extension, and every extension uses the same public interfaces available to anyone. The C# kernel, the dark theme, and the dashboard layout all ship as extensions with no special access to engine internals. If a built-in feature needs an internal API to work, the interfaces are incomplete.

## Languages

| Language | IntelliSense | Variable Sharing |
|----------|:------------:|:----------------:|
| C#         | Yes | Yes |
| F#         | Yes | Yes |
| JavaScript | Yes* | Yes |
| TypeScript | Yes* | Yes |
| PowerShell | Yes | Yes |
| Python     | Yes | Yes |
| SQL        | Yes | Yes |
| HTTP       | Yes | Yes |
| Markdown   | N/A | N/A |
| HTML       | N/A | Yes |
| Mermaid    | N/A | Yes |

\* IntelliSense for JavaScript and TypeScript is provided by Monaco's built-in language services rather than the kernel.

## Architecture

Verso is split into three layers. The engine knows nothing about the UI. The UI knows nothing about the host environment. Extensions work identically everywhere.

|  Scaffold - Extension Host - Execution Pipeline           |
|  Layout Manager - Theme Engine - Variable Store           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|  Verso.Abstractions                                       |
|  Pure interfaces, zero dependencies                       |
|  The only package extension authors need to reference     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Front-ends** provide the user experience. Blazor Server talks to the engine directly, in-process. VS Code runs Blazor WebAssembly in a webview, communicating with a host process over JSON-RPC. Both share the same Razor components so the notebook experience is identical. The CLI drives the engine headlessly for CI pipelines and automated workflows.

**The engine** is a headless .NET library. `Scaffold` orchestrates a notebook session: cell management, kernel dispatch, execution, cross-kernel variable sharing, and subsystem coordination. Every language kernel, theme, layout, and formatter ships as an extension using the same public interfaces available to third-party authors.

**Verso.Abstractions** contains only interfaces and the `[VersoExtension]` attribute. It is the sole dependency for extension authors and has zero transitive dependencies.

For a deeper look at each layer, see the [architecture documentation](docs/architecture/overview.md).

## Features

### Code Execution with IntelliSense

![C# code execution with IntelliSense](https://datafication.co/assets/verso/VersoIntelliSense.gif)

All language kernels provide completions, diagnostics, and hover information. NuGet packages are referenced inline with `#r "nuget: PackageName/Version"`, and custom package sources are supported with `#i "nuget: <url>"`. Python uses `#!pip` for package management, and JavaScript uses `#!npm` for npm packages. State persists across cells within each kernel, and variables are shared across kernels through a central variable store.

### Layouts

The same notebook can be viewed as a linear document or rearranged into a 12-column grid dashboard. Drag cells to reposition them, resize with handles, and the layout metadata is saved in the `.verso` file. Switch between layouts at runtime.

### Database Connectivity

Verso.Ado provides provider-agnostic SQL connectivity through ADO.NET. Connect to any supported database, execute queries with paginated result tables, inspect schema, and scaffold EF Core DbContext classes at runtime. SQL results are shared to the variable store for use in C#, F#, and other cells. See the [database connectivity guide](docs/guides/database-connectivity.md) for connection setup, provider support, EF Core scaffolding, and CI/CD pipeline examples.

### HTTP Requests

Verso.Http uses `.http` file syntax (the same format supported by VS Code REST Client and JetBrains HTTP Client). Features include variable interpolation, dynamic variables, named request chaining, and cross-kernel integration where response data is shared to C#, F#, and other cells.

### JavaScript and TypeScript

Verso.JavaScript provides full JavaScript and TypeScript execution in notebook cells. When Node.js is available, cells run in a persistent subprocess with access to `require()`, dynamic `import()`, top-level `await`, and npm packages installed via the `#!npm` magic command. In environments without Node.js, the JavaScript kernel falls back to Jint, a pure .NET ES2024 interpreter with no external dependencies. TypeScript cells are automatically transpiled using the TypeScript compiler API (auto-installed on first use) and share the same execution environment and variable scope as JavaScript cells.

### Rich Content Cells

Markdown (rendered via Markdig), raw HTML, and Mermaid diagram cells all support `@variable` substitution from the shared variable store, enabling dynamic documents that update when data changes.

### Themes

Three built-in themes (Light, Dark, High Contrast) are hot-swappable at runtime. The High Contrast theme meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements. In VS Code, the notebook theme automatically follows your editor theme.

### Import from Jupyter and Polyglot Notebooks

Open any `.ipynb` or `.dib` file and Verso converts it automatically. Polyglot Notebook patterns like `#!fsharp`, `#!connect`, and `#!sql` are mapped to native Verso cells during import. Saving writes to a `.verso` file, preserving the original.

## Extension Model

Eleven interfaces in `Verso.Abstractions` define every point of extensibility, covering language kernels, cell renderers, cell types, toolbar actions, data formatters, magic commands, themes, layouts, serializers, post-processors, and cell interaction handlers. Extensions can also implement `IExtensionSettings` to expose configurable settings in the UI.

Third-party extensions load in their own `AssemblyLoadContext`, collectible and unloadable. Your extension references only `Verso.Abstractions` and works across every front-end without modification.

```bash
dotnet new verso-extension -n MyExtension
```

Verso includes a `dotnet new` template, a testing library (`Verso.Testing`), and sample extensions in the repo. For the full interface reference and extension host internals, see the [extension documentation](docs/extensions/) and [extension host architecture](docs/architecture/extension-host.md).

      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (for the extension, desktop only) or any modern browser (for Blazor)
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) (optional, for the JavaScript/TypeScript kernel; falls back to Jint when absent)
- [Python 3.8-3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (optional, for the Python kernel)

### Run in the Browser

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DataficationSDK/Verso
cd Verso
dotnet build Verso.sln
dotnet run --project src/Verso.Blazor
```

### Run from the Command Line

Verso ships as a .NET global tool. Install it once, then launch the editor, run notebooks headlessly, or convert between formats from any terminal.

```bash
# Install the CLI
dotnet tool install -g Verso.Cli

# Launch the Verso editor in your browser
verso serve

# Open a specific notebook
verso serve my-notebook.verso

# Run a notebook headlessly
verso run pipeline.verso --param region=us-east --output json

# Convert a Jupyter notebook to Verso format
verso convert notebook.ipynb --to verso

# Start an interactive REPL (C# by default; switch with .kernel fsharp, .kernel python, ...)
verso repl

# Export a notebook through a registered ExportMenu action
verso export notebook.verso --format html --output out.html
```

The CLI includes six commands:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `verso serve` | Launch the Verso editor as a local web server |
| `verso run` | Execute a notebook headlessly and stream outputs |
| `verso repl` | Interactive REPL hosted in the terminal, backed by the same kernels and extensions as the editor |
| `verso convert` | Convert between `.verso`, `.ipynb`, and `.dib` formats |
| `verso export` | Export a notebook via an `ExportMenu` toolbar action (HTML, Markdown, …) |
| `verso info` | Display CLI version, runtime, and extension details |

`verso run` supports typed parameters (`--param name=value`), JSON output for CI integration, selective cell execution, and fail-fast mode. `verso repl` supports completion, persistent history, multi-line cell submission (blank-line to submit), and meta-commands like `.kernel`, `.vars`, `.save`, `.load`, and `.export`. See the [CLI README](src/Verso.Cli/README.md) for the full option reference, meta-command list, exit codes, and CI/CD examples.

### Run in VS Code

```bash
dotnet build src/Verso.Host -f net10.0
cd vscode
npm install
npm run build:all
npx vsce package --skip-license
```

Install the `.vsix` file, then open any `.verso` file. Use **Open With...** to import `.ipynb` or `.dib` files.

### Run the Tests

```bash
dotnet test Verso.sln
```
