# Verso.FSharp

F# Interactive language kernel extension for [Verso](https://github.com/DataficationSDK/Verso) notebooks.

## Overview

Full F# scripting powered by FSharp.Compiler.Service. Latest F# language version, persistent state across cells, IntelliSense, diagnostics, hover info, and NuGet package references.

### Features

- **F# Interactive session** with configurable warning level, language version, and default opens
- **IntelliSense** with dot-completion, error diagnostics, and hover info (type signatures and documentation)
- **NuGet references** via `#r "nuget: PackageName"` with dual-path resolution (FSI built-in or Verso fallback)
- **Script directives** (`#r`, `#load`, `#I`, `#nowarn`, and `#time`)
- **Bidirectional variable sharing** between F# and other kernels
- **Rich data formatting** for discriminated unions, records, options, results, maps, sets, tuples, and collections
- **Configurable settings** for warning level, language version, private binding visibility, and collection display limits
- **Polyglot Notebooks migration** with automatic conversion of `#!fsharp`/`#!f#`, `#!set`, and `#!share` patterns during `.ipynb` and `.dib` import
